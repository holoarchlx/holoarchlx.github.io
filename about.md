In 2000 HoloARCH was founded in the USA. Its founding partners are registered architects in the US with professional experience of more than 30 years, including many years as senior designers in the world-renowned architect’s offices or top international design corporations such as Pei Partnership, Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates, and Perkins+Will. The partners have worked on many significant projects in North America, Europe, Asia including the United Arab Emirates and China.

HoloARCH’s chief designers have extensive experience on variety of building types among which commercial (including office, retail, hotel, and etc.), healthcare, educational, residential as well as high-rise buildings are our expertise, while green design, under supervision of our design directors as US Green Building Council’s LEED AP, is our strongly specialized area for all building types and urban design projects.

HoloARCH’s design philosophy and design methodology emphasize total, whole, or “holo” information relevant to projects and their locations on the earth, which informs us of “holo” ideas toward ideal forms of architecture and urbanism in harmony with the Nature.
